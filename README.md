# tvPersistence.jl

The code has been developed in Julia as a code accompanying the Barunik and Vacha (2022) paper, and provides estimation of time-varying persistence using *distributional deep learning* introduced in

Barun√≠k, J. and Vacha, L. (2022): *Time-Varying Persistence of Economic Variables*, manuscript [available here for download](https://barunik.github.io)


## Software requirements

Install [Julia](http://julialang.org/) version 1.6.0 or newer and with the first use of this code install the same version of packages with which the projects is built and work in the environment of the project as

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".") # activating project in its directory
Pkg.instantiate() # installing packages with which versions the project is built
```

# TBD soon

The package is coming soon.
